~> **End of life notice**
In March 2024, a new licensing model was announced for Redis® that impacts the Aiven for Caching offering (formerly Aiven for Redis®).
Aiven for Caching is entering its end-of-life cycle to comply with Redis's copyright and license agreements.
From **February 15th, 2025**, it will not be possible to start a new Aiven for Caching service, but existing services up until version 7.2 will still be available until end of life.
From **March 31st, 2025**, Aiven for Caching will no longer be available and all existing services will be migrated to Aiven for Valkey™.
You can [upgrade to Valkey for free](https://aiven.io/docs/products/caching/howto/upgrade-aiven-for-caching-to-valkey) before then 
and [update your existing `aiven_redis` resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs/guides/update-deprecated-resources#update-aiven_redis-resources-after-valkey-upgrade).
