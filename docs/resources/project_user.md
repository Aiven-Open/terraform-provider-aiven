## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) Email address of the user. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- `member_type` (String) Project membership type. The possible values are `admin`, `developer` and `operator`.
- `project` (String) Identifies the project this resource belongs to. To set up proper dependencies please refer to this variable as a reference. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `accepted` (Boolean) Whether the user has accepted the request to join the project; adding user to a project sends an invitation to the target user and the actual membership is only created once the user accepts the invitation.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `default` (String)
